# Tauri + Vue + TypeScript

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Development

### Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev:desktop
```

Build for production:
```bash
pnpm build:desktop
```

### Android Setup

#### Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or later)** - Download from [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager
2. **Android SDK** - Install via Android Studio or command line tools
3. **NDK (Native Development Kit)** - Required for Rust compilation
4. **Rust** - Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) with Android targets:
   ```bash
   rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi x86_64-linux-android i686-linux-android
   ```
5. **Rust Analyzer** for IDE support (optional but recommended)

#### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables:
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17" # Adjust path as needed
$env:ANDROID_HOME = "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk"
$env:NDK_HOME = "$env:ANDROID_HOME\ndk\25.2.9519653" # Adjust NDK version as needed

# macOS/Linux
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-17
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/25.2.9519653
```

#### Initial Setup

Initialize the Android project:
```bash
pnpm init:android
```

#### Development & Testing

Start development server for Android:
```bash
pnpm dev:android
```

Build debug APK:
```bash
pnpm build:android
```

Install APK on connected device:
```bash
pnpm install:android
```

Ensure you have a device connected via USB with USB debugging enabled, or an Android emulator running.

#### Signing Release Builds

Android APKs must be signed with a digital certificate to be installable on devices. See the [official Tauri Android signing documentation](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/android/) for detailed instructions.

**Quick Summary:**

1. **Create a keystore** using `keytool` (PKCS12 format is recommended over JKS):
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.p12 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload -storetype PKCS12
   ```

2. **Create a keystore.properties file** at `src-tauri/gen/android/keystore.properties`:
   ```properties
   password=<password from keytool>
   keyAlias=upload
   storeFile=<path to upload-keystore.p12>
   ```
   > Keep both the keystore and properties file private; don't commit them to version control.

3. **Configure Gradle** in `src-tauri/gen/android/app/build.gradle.kts` to use the signing key for release builds.

For CI/CD environments (e.g., GitHub Actions), use secrets to securely pass the keystore and credentials.

#### Testing Mobile Screen Size on Desktop

To test responsive design for mobile during development without deploying to a device:

**Using Tauri Mobile Configuration:**
   - Edit `src-tauri/tauri.mobile.conf.json` to adjust the window size for testing
   - Run `pnpm dev:mobile` to test with mobile-specific settings

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can enable Volar's Take Over mode by following these steps:

1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VS Code's command palette, look for `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, then right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`. By default, Take Over mode will enable itself if the default TypeScript extension is disabled.
2. Reload the VS Code window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

You can learn more about Take Over mode [here](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471).
